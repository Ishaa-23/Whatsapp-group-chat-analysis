Please feel free to extend this invitation to your alumni and leverage their real-time professional experience to lead in the Top College with Maximum Participation category.

Aligning with our Group-wide purpose of unleashing human energy through technology for an inclusive and sustainable future, this year‚Äôs theme ‚ÄòHacking for Positive Futures‚Äô aims to encourage tech enthusiasts to come together, brainstorm, and create solutions for an inclusive and sustainable future.

There are prizes worth INR 15,00,000* to be won along with a chance to land a dream job with us*! The top 55 finalists will also be exclusively mentored by Capgemini subject matter experts and get to display their tech skills in front of a C-suite jury of celebrated leaders from the start-up, academia, and IT industry.

Crack the Campus Challenge
We have a distinct Campus Challenge for colleges, wherein the top 5 colleges with maximum participation in Level 1 will win trophies and, respective Placement Officers will get an exclusive invite to the grand finale.

We at Skill Safari completely understand that being a department/placement in change is not easy and to top it all up, there is a lockdown as well. When the nation fights the pandemic, it is also important for us to focus on our student's career and future.

We understand that your pre-final and final year students are looking for an internship 

We are selecting candidates for Skill Safari's Summer internship program 2021.

Due to the current pandemic/lockdown situation, we are doing a remote and virtual internship program. Students from any part of the country can now work on some very interesting projects at Skill Safari. 

This is a perfect opportunity for your prefinal year students to do a mandatory internship even during these tough times.

We have scheduled an orientation program to explain the process and details to the interested candidates. Kindly share the below link with your Pre-final year students so that they can attend the internship orientation session.

Trust you and your near and dear ones are all doing well.

We all have lived through these trying times and hope that very soon there will be light at the end of the tunnel.

Also hope that in-person college classes and attendance will start soon.

 

This mail is to let you know that we will have Deep Blue Season 7. The Launch event will mostly be in person in the month of November instead of October.

Do let me know of a suitable time towards end August or mid-Sept for an audience with your 2nd, 3rd and Final year engg students asking for their participation.

 

Just to let you know that for Season 6, Prize money was equally distributed to 7 finalist teams (25 team members) as the Finals were not held. Certificates are already given to Finalists. Participation certificates to all those who presented are still pending.

We hired 3 Final year BE students from the Finalists. Rest ( from the finalist teams) had plans of further studies or they declined.

 

SO , please be ready for Season 7 .

 

Looking forward to your continued co-operation.

04/01/2022, 12:27 - +91 97682 87595: Greetings from Campus Credential!!

 

We have had a fruitful association with placements for a few years now, and we want to grow this association even further. Campus Credential is happy to announce the introduction of GRE and CAT training.

We have been training students for competitive exams for years now, and have also had a good conversion rate. We have helped students get into their dream colleges in India and abroad. Our aim is not just helping the students crack the exams; we aim in helping the students overall.

Overall for us includes A-Z in terms of admissions, we guide them in every step. Our programs are divided into two parts: 1) Exam Preparation, and 2) Admissions Counseling.

In admissions counseling, our counselors will help the students in selecting the courses, colleges, countries, etc. that are best for them. The counselors will help them in securing loans and visas. They will make sure all the documentation of the students are ready and in order. They will help them in writing essays, SOPs, and any other documents that they may require.

Because admissions counseling is very individualized, as each student will have their own preferences and needs, we don‚Äôt undertake admissions counseling at college level.

Exam preparation on the other hand is something that we can take at college level, as it includes preparing them for the entrance exams. We will cover everything that will be required for the specific exam, along with mock tests, study materials, doubt solving sessions, and revision sessions.

Just like we have been training your students for placements, we will start training all the interested students for competitive exams like CAT and GRE. It will become easier for students, as they don‚Äôt have to search for other classes outside and can prepare for everything in the college itself. Plus, it will also help the college track the students who are interested in further studies and then showcase the successful converts to prospective students.

New admissions will know that their college is not just working on teaching them the prescribed portion, it is working on ensuring their students have an outstanding future. From placements training to further studies admissions training, you are helping them in every way that you can.

You have already trusted us with your students for placement training and have had good results because of the same. We ask you to further trust us with your students for CAT and GRE training. We have the best trainers and counselors who will ensure that your students get the best opportunities.

Thank you for your time and patience. Let us know when we can further work on this project.

 

Thanks & Regards,

Vinay Raikar

Greetings!

The Training & Placement Cell plans to initiate Japanese Language training for the students of Second- and Third-year Engineering (EXTC, CE, IT, ME, ECS) to cater to the growing demand in the industry for bilingual skillset. 

Two of our prime recruiters, Capgemini and Wipro Technologies have recommended the training for all students from first to third year to hire and relocate the candidates with bilingual skillset for overseas assignments.

Given the need of the industry and the rapport with the recruiters, we have initiated the discussion with the trainers offering training in Japanese language. The students will have to take the Japanese Language Proficiency test (JLPT), conducted by the Japanese Government, at the end of each level to qualify for international assignments. 

As discussed with the recruiters, students must complete JLPT - N5 and N4 certification, to be eligible for Capgemini and Wipro overseas appointment.

We have invited proposals from three trainers and will schedule demo sessions for the students to understand the training modules and cost.

We request for your support to cascade the information to the students.

Regards

Ms Seema Khan
